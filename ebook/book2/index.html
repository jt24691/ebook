    <h1>Trevor’s Song (intro)</h1>
      <p>The Book was written by Troy A. Beam, it was about the strength of faith of the parents and the son.
       <br>This is about a boy who got caught by an auger, in a piece of farm equipment, which just about killed
    <br>him, and how God saved his life and restored his badly torn leg. He progressed from a medically induced
    <br>coma to walking around and climbing around like nothing happened three months later.</p>

  <h1>Body</h1>

    <p>  The incident happened when Trevor Beam’s foot got pulled into the Auger severely ripping his legs,
  <br>  puncturing his head and chest, and severing his major blood vessels.  God did Miraculous touches and
  <br>  healings for the young eight-year-old. Especially since he went through the auger. He most likely would
  <br>  have died if not his brothers turned off the machine.
      <br>His cheery attitude had a positive effect on all the nurses who would come to his ICU room and ask him
    <br>questions and listen to his story. The doctors initially wanted to amputate his right leg due to the
    <Br>damage and danger of infection, but his parents objected because they wanted to give God a chance to
    <br>heal him and wanted Trevor to have a normal life. The doctor prayed with them as well. As the doctors
    <br>conducted the emergency surgery Troy and Debbie prayed off and on for five and a half hours
      <Br>After an emergency surgery his leg muscle reattached like nothing happened. His calf muscle was
    <br>filleted like a fish also two of the main arteries were severed off.

<br>     After about a week or so he began to walk again and even climb roofs with no pain and even walked to
    <br>his second checkup. Then at the end of the book he was fully healed but his leg didn’t look totally
    <br>normal due to the fat layer of the muscle not growing back.
      <br>Today Trevor is normal as any other young man his age, you will notice no abnormalities unless he is
    wearing shorts.</p>
