    <h1 class="segment">Trevor’s Song (intro)</h1>
      <p class="intro">The Book was written by Troy A. Beam, it was about the strength of faith of the parents and the son.
       This is about a boy who got caught by an auger, in a piece of farm equipment, which just about killed
    him, and how God saved his life and restored his badly torn leg. He progressed from a medically induced
    coma to walking around and climbing around like nothing happened three months later.</p>

  <h1 class="segment">Body</h1>

    <p class="text">  The incident happened when Trevor Beam’s foot got pulled into the Auger severely ripping his legs,
    puncturing his head and chest, and severing his major blood vessels.  God did Miraculous touches and
    healings for the young eight-year-old. Especially since he went through the auger. He most likely would
    have died if not his brothers turned off the machine.
      His cheery attitude had a positive effect on all the nurses who would come to his ICU room and ask him
    questions and listen to his story. The doctors initially wanted to amputate his right leg due to the
    damage and danger of infection, but his parents objected because they wanted to give God a chance to
    heal him and wanted Trevor to have a normal life. The doctor prayed with them as well. As the doctors
    conducted the emergency surgery Troy and Debbie prayed off and on for five and a half hours
      After an emergency surgery his leg muscle reattached like nothing happened. His calf muscle was
    filleted like a fish also two of the main arteries were severed off.

     After about a week or so he began to walk again and even climb roofs with no pain and even walked to
    his second checkup. Then at the end of the book he was fully healed but his leg didn’t look totally
    normal due to the fat layer of the muscle not growing back.
      Today Trevor is normal as any other young man his age, you will notice no abnormalities unless he is
    wearing shorts.</p>
