  Jeep’s first name was G.P. which stands for “general purpose” which was designated by the army. <br>When they began to sell them to the public, they were so used to being called G.P.s that they called them Jeeps instead.<br>

The first Jeep was called the Willy it served from WW2 to the Korean war. <br>Then other models like the Commanders, Liberty, Renegade, Patriot, and the newer truck.<br> It is blocky and it reminds me of the game called Minecraft.<br> Since everything was blocky similar to Minecraft.<br>

If you take care of your Jeep you should be able to get 10-20 years with some issues popping up here and there.<br>

Remember to drive safe and to watch for slick spots even in a 4wd vehicle they still will slide.
