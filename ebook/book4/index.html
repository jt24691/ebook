      <h1>The History of the Jeep</h1>
    </div>
          <div class="text">
        <br><br><br><br><p>The Jeep was first developed as a general purpose vehicle for the U.S. Army. It was shortened to G.P. on the paperwork and was referred to as a G. P. in Army slang. <br>When General Motors began to sell them to the public, they were so used to being called G.P.s that the company called them Jeeps instead.<br>

      The first Jeep was called the Willy it served from WW2 to the Korean war. <br>Then other models like the Commanders, Liberty, Renegade, Patriot, and the newer truck.<br> It is blocky and it reminds me of the game called Minecraft.<br> Since everything was blocky similar to Minecraft.<br>

      If you take care of your Jeep you should be able to get 10-20 years with some issues popping up here and there.<br>

      Remember to drive safe and to watch for slick spots even in a 4wd vehicle they still will slide.
